# Sports Image Classification

This repository contains a deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) image classification model training to classify different sports types. The AI model used for the classification task is RexNet ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/clovaai/rexnet)) and the dataset for training is [Jellyfish Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types). The project in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/killa92/pytorch-classification-100-test-accuracy).
